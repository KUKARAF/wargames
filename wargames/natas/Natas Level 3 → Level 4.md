Not even google will find it this time? Interesting!

Google crawls or doesn't crawl a website based on the [robots.txt](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/intro) file. this file is public and google obeys everything described in it like: google please do not access those sensitive files. We have no such limitations though. 

Indeed when we load [/robots.txt](http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/robots.txt) we find: 

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /s3cr3t/  
```

This leads us to [users.txt](natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/s3cr3t/users.txt) and ultimately to the password:
